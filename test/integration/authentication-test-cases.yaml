tests:
  001 - should successfully regenerate access token when it has expired because keyring installed:
    command: go run ./test/integration/scripts/expire-access-token.go && auth0 apps list # `auth0 apps list` is arbitrarily selected, can be most commands
    exit-code: 0

  002a - disable keyring:
    command: ./test/integration/scripts/uninstall-keyring.sh
    exit-code: 0

  002b - should successfully make any request after keyring disabled:
    command: auth0 apps list
    exit-code: 0
