# Embedded data

This directory contains files that get embedded into the CLI binary.

## Contents

### Rule templates
A series of JS files prefixed with `rule-template-`. Each file contains a single rule that can be used as a code template when creating a new rule with `auth0 rules create`.

### Action templates
A series of JS files prefixed with `action-template-`, each containing an empty action for a given extensibility point. There's an empty action for each extensibility point. These are used as code templates for new actions created with `auth0 actions create`.

### Quickstart data
`quickstarts.json` contains all the Quickstarts data needed by the `auth0 quickstarts list` and `auth0 quickstarts download` commands, as there's no web service to get this data from.

The file can be generated by running [this Python script](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli/blob/quickstarts-json-generator/qsgen/main.py). It needs to be regenerated whenever the list of Quickstarts change, that is when there is a new Quickstart or when an old one gets removed or replaced.
