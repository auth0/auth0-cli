# Auth package

The CLI authentication follows this approach:

1. `$ auth0 login` uses **Auth0 Device Flow** to get an `acccess token` and a `refresh token` for the selected tenant.
1. The access token is stored at the configuration file.
1. The refresh token is stored at the OS keychain (supports macOS, Linux, and Windows thanks to https://github.com/zalando/go-keyring).
1. During regular commands initialization, the access token is used to instantiate an Auth0 API client. 
		- If the token is expired according to the value stored on the configuration file, a new one is requested using the refresh token. 
		- In case of any error, the interactive login flow is triggered.
