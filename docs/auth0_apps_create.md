Create a new application

### Synopsis

Create a new application.

```
auth0 apps create [flags]
```

### Examples

```
auth0 apps create 
auth0 apps create --name myapp 
auth0 apps create -n myapp --type [native|spa|regular|m2m]
auth0 apps create -n myapp -t [native|spa|regular|m2m] --description <description>
```

### Options

```
  -a, --auth-method string    Defines the requested authentication method for the token endpoint. Possible values are 'None' (public application without a client secret), 'Post' (application uses HTTP POST parameters) or 'Basic' (application uses HTTP Basic).
  -c, --callbacks strings     After the user authenticates we will only call back to any of these URLs. You can specify multiple valid URLs by comma-separating them (typically to handle different environments like QA or testing). Make sure to specify the protocol (https://) otherwise the callback may fail in some cases. With the exception of custom URI schemes for native apps, all callbacks should use protocol https://.
  -d, --description string    Description of the application. Max character count is 140.
  -g, --grants strings        List of grant types supported for this application. Can include code, implicit, refresh-token, credentials, password, password-realm, mfa-oob, mfa-otp, mfa-recovery-code, and device-code.
  -h, --help                  help for create
  -l, --logout-urls strings   Comma-separated list of URLs that are valid to redirect to after logout from Auth0. Wildcards are allowed for subdomains.
  -n, --name string           Name of the application.
  -o, --origins strings       Comma-separated list of URLs allowed to make requests from JavaScript to Auth0 API (typically used with CORS). By default, all your callback URLs will be allowed. This field allows you to enter other origins if necessary. You can also use wildcards at the subdomain level (e.g., https://*.contoso.com). Query strings and hash information are not taken into account when validating these URLs.
  -r, --reveal                Display the Client Secret as part of the command output.
  -t, --type string           Type of application:
                              - native: mobile, desktop, CLI and smart device apps running natively.
                              - spa (single page application): a JavaScript front-end app that uses an API.
                              - regular: Traditional web app using redirects.
                              - m2m (machine to machine): CLIs, daemons or services running on your backend.
  -w, --web-origins strings   Comma-separated list of allowed origins for use with Cross-Origin Authentication, Device Flow, and web message response mode.
