# auth0 protection breached-password-detection

Breached password detection protects your applications from bad actors signing up or logging in with stolen credentials. Auth0 can notify users and/or block accounts that are at risk.

Auth0 tracks large security breaches that occur on major third-party sites. If Auth0 identifies that any of your usersâ€™ credentials were part of a breach, the breached password detection security feature triggers.
