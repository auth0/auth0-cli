# auth0 protection suspicious-ip-throttling

Suspicious IP throttling blocks traffic from any IP address that rapidly attempts too many logins or signups. This helps protect your applications from high-velocity attacks that target multiple accounts. Suspicious IP throttling is enabled by default when you create your Auth0 tenant.

When Auth0 detects a high number of signup attempts or failed login attempts from an IP address, it suspends further attempts from that IP address. You can customize how suspicious IP throttling works for your tenant.
