# auth0 domains

With a custom domain, your users feel confident that they are providing their credentials to the right party. Authentication happens within the context of your brand which helps you build brand loyalty. Users are not redirected to a third-party site that breaks the branding context. This prevents users from becoming confused about whether they are still making a transaction or operation with you.
